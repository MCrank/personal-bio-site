# Personal Bio Site

This project was built to test our skills we have learned over the past 6 months in the front end development bootcamp. The project started out as just vanilla JavaScript/html/CSS and as we learned new technologies and skills we updated this project as time progressed. This site is a showcase of some of the projects I have completed over the past 6 months (Aug 2018 - Jan 2018) both by myself and in a group/team environment using the knowledge gained from the bootcamp. It also details a little bit about my background and offers my resume for download.

## Requirements

- Create a personal biography site using the technologies and skills learned in the course to promote ourselves and showcase several of our projects.
